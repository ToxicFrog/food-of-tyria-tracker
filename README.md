# food-of-tyria

This is a simple web-based lookup tool and tracker for food recipes from Guild Wars. On first run it will initialize itself with information from the GW2 API about what cooking recipes are available, which may take some time. It has no concept of ownership or different users, so it's best used as a local tool or on a small home network.

It will probably not be useful to anyone but me, but I've uploaded it as an example of a simple (if somewhat sloppy) Ring/Compojure/Hiccup/Codax application.

## Running
